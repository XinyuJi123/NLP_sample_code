# NLP_sample_code

"Sample code.ipynb" is the main code which consists of three functions: 1. extraction of txt titles, 2. extraction of researcher names, 
3. and labelling of researcher genders by java and html. 

If you only want to play with the third function, you can directly use the three json files as input, which are the final name extraction results of 
the five txt files.
