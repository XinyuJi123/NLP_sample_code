# NLP_sample_code

There are two versions of nlp sample codes for the purpose of researcher name extraction from news content, using Spacy and nltk respectively.
For the purpose of demonstration, news are extracted from "Science Daily" website,(https://www.sciencedaily.com/) and stored inside the folder "News" (inside both nlp parent folders)


In both nlp parent folders, "Sample code.ipynb" or "Sample code.py" (you can pick one to your liking) is the main file with three functions: 

1. Extracting news titles from file names; 
2. Extracting researcher names from news content; 
3. Labelling researcher genders by Javascript and HTML for the analysis of gender bias. 

Once user runs the codes, three json files should be expected as outputs, including:
1. json file containing news tiles;
2. json file containing researcher names;
3. json file containing researcher genders.


Codes are still WIP v1.0.
